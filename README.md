# NeoVim Configuration Directory

Sensible NeoVim configuration. Contains settings from [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) along with my own changes.

## Installing On Your Own System

Run the following commands to install on your system,

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/adibis/.nvim.git
    ln -s ~/.nvim/nvimrc.vim ~/.nvimrc

More stuff will be added as the NeoVim project matures.
