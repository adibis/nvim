# Neovim Configuration Directory

Sensible NeoVim configuration. Contains settings from [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible) along with my own changes.

## Installing On Your Own System

Run the following commands to install on your system,

    cd ~
    git clone git://github.com/adibis/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
    nvim +PlugInstall +qall

More stuff will be added as the Neovim project matures.
